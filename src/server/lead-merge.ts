/**
 * Finding and merging duplicate leads.

 * New duplicates are refused where they are made: a lead whose email address,
 * phone number or WhatsApp number is already on a lead or a contact cannot be
 * created (20260928000001_duplicate_rule.sql), and a campaign member who is
 * already a lead is linked to that lead on conversion rather than made into a
 * second one. What this screen finds is what got in before that rule, on the
 * same keys.
 *
 * The person who can tell whether two records are one human is the agent working
 * them, so merging is a deliberate act with a screen behind it rather than a
 * guess.
