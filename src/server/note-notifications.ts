 * the note is the real work and it is already written. A mail server being
 * unreachable must never lose it. Failures are returned rather than thrown, and
 * the caller records which recipients actually got through so an unsent mention
 * stays visibly unsent rather than silently pretending.
 *
 * The service-role client is used throughout. The recipient may sit outside the
 * author's data scope — mentioning a colleague in another department is the
 * normal case, not an edge one.
