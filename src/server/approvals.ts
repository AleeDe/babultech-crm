/**
 * Everything waiting on a decision, in one queue.
 *
 * Approvals are not centralised in the database and deliberately stay that
 * way: quotations, expenses, timesheets, vendor bills and partner rate requests each
 * carry their own status column and their own transition rules, and those
 * rules differ — an expense cannot be approved by the person who claimed it,
 * a quotation can be revised instead of rejected. Rewriting five working
 * mechanisms onto one generic table would risk all of them to gain a shared
 * shape nothing actually needs.
 *
 * What was missing is the view across them. This reads each source, filters to
 * what the reader is allowed to approve, and returns one list — so nobody has
 * to remember which of five screens is holding something up.
 *
 * Each item links to where the decision is actually made, because that screen
 * has the context the approver needs.
