/**
 * Switching the dashboard between the whole business and one part of it.
 *
 * The dashboard put twenty-seven panels on one screen — pipeline, cash, delivery
 * load, support, partners, an activity stream and a change log, all at once. Each
 * one was individually reasonable and the sum was unreadable: everything equally
 * prominent is the same as nothing being prominent.
 *
 * Splitting by business area works here because the app already thinks that way.
 * The five module flags on the summary are permission-derived, so the views a
 * person can open are exactly the areas their role can see — a consultant is
 * never offered a Finance view that would refuse them, and nobody has to
 * maintain a second list of who sees what.
 *
 * The choice lives in the URL rather than component state, so a link to the
 * finance view is a link to the finance view — shareable, reloadable, and
 * survivable through the back button. `replace` keeps back meaning "the previous
 * page" rather than stepping through every tab visited.
 *
 * The dot beside each label carries the module's validated colour, which is the
 * same colour that module's marks use in every chart. Colour follows the entity,
 * so a reader learns "teal is finance" once.
