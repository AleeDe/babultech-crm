 * Human-readable record numbers (spec §1.1: "separate unique fields generated

 * The allocation itself lives in the database — `next_sequence_number()` in
 * supabase/functions-sql/009_fn_numbering.sql — because it must happen in the same
 * transaction as the insert it numbers. Allocating here and inserting in a
 * separate HTTP call would burn a number whenever the insert failed.
 *
 * Prefer `createRecord(table, payload, { field, sequence })` from lib/db, which
 * does both in one call. Use this directly only when a number is needed without
 * an immediate insert.
