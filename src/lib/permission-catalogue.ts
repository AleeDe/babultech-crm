/**
 * Every permission a role can hold, in words an administrator can act on.
 *
 * The strings are the same ones src/lib/authz.ts checks and every server action
 * demands; this file only says what each one means and groups them the way
 * somebody thinks about the business. A permission missing from here still
 * works - it just cannot be granted from Settings, which is why the list is
 * kept in step with PERMISSIONS.
 *
 * `implies` records the coarse grants that carry narrower ones, so the screen
 * can show that ticking "Everything about invoices" already covers issuing one.
 * The matching is done by can() in authz.ts; this is the explanation of it.
