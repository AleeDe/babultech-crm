/**
 * What each screen is for, and where it sits in the chain.
 *
 * Every page already carries a one-line description, and there is a 536-line
 * guide at /guide. Neither answers the question people actually ask on arriving
 * at a screen they have not used: *what feeds this, and what does it turn into?*
 * Two of eighty pages mentioned a connection to anything else.
 *
 * That matters here more than in most systems, because almost nothing in this
 * app stands alone — a quote exists because a deal does, a contract because a
 * quote was accepted, commission because a partner was attached to a lead months
 * earlier. Someone who cannot see the chain will create records in the wrong
 * order and then wonder why a dropdown is empty, which is most of the questions
 * asked so far.
 *
 * Kept in one file rather than inline on each page so the chain can be read and
 * corrected as a whole. A wrong `feeds` here is a lie about how the system
 * works, and lies are easier to spot side by side than scattered across eighty
 * files.
